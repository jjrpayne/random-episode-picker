# Random Episode Picker

This is a web app that randomly picks an episode from a TV show of your choice.

If you don't know what episode of a show you want to watch why not randomly select one? 
Just type the name of a show in the search bar, and the results will show up automatically.
Click on the thumbnail of the show you want to watch to randomly select an episode.
